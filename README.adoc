An advance command line parse tool replace Getopt::Kinoko

= Description

`Getopt::Advance` is a powerful command line option parsing module, it suppot many
style such as: `unix-style`、`gnu-style`、`bsd-style`.etc. It support `Hash`、`Array`

`radio`、`multi` group mechanism which can manage option realtionship. And to handle
non-option argument, it provide `main`、`pos` and `cmd` feature.

= Usage

== Try it

=== Normal version

[source,raku]
---------------

    "h|help=b",
    "print help message.",
    callback => sub ($, $) {
        say "The h option is set by user";
    });

&getopt($os);
